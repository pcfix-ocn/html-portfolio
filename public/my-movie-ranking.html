  <h1>The Best Films According to Horace</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 films of all time.</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Shogun</h3>
  <p>
    I first read this 1975 novel by James Clavell while i was in high school. It was set in 16th Century Feudal Japan in the days of the Samurai and the Shogunate. Then a film was made in 1980 that was shown on TV. I remember watching it with members of my family after dinner until the break of dawn. My dad joined us because he was curious why everyone was up so late.
    <p>
      I have since read the book more than 3 times. And the excitement still <b><i>lives on</i></b>.

  <h3>Top Gun</h3>
    <p>
    I'm just crazy about fighter jets. And I believe that the Grumman F-14 Tomcat F-14 was one of the best. It went into service in 1974 and was finally retired in 2006.
      <p>This movie is about the pilots who flew this great machine and how the Navy made sure that the dogfighting skills of these pilots did not fade away. Great movie and storyline.

  <h3>The Man Who Died of <i>Palamanog</i></h3>
    <p>
    I just made up  (or borrowed) this movie title, from my Dad, because it reminds me of him. He was funny and a natural jokester and a source of folklores and "ancient" sayings. This was his favorite reply whenever he's asked what movie he wanted to see. :-) <i>Palamanog</i> is a local dialect which closely means <i>owning up to something that you did</i>.
